Which component do you add to a GameObject to make the GameObject be pulled by gravity?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Collider

  --- feedback ---

  Try again! A collider is used in Unity to detect collisions. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Script

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. Unity has a component that will allow you to use gravity without having to write any extra code in a script.

- (x) RigidBody

  --- feedback ---

  That's right. One of the reasons to add a RigidBody is to use gravity.

- ( ) Material

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. You can add Physic Materials to GameObjects to create friction and bounciness. You added a different component to use gravity.
